Several solutions can address this inconsistent styling issue:

**1. JavaScript-based Styling:**

The most reliable solution might be to handle the styling using JavaScript.  This provides more direct control and avoids potential browser-specific inconsistencies.

```javascript
const listItems = document.querySelectorAll('li');
listItems.forEach((item, index) => {
  if (index % 2 === 1) {
    item.style.backgroundColor = '#f0f0f0';
  }
});
```

**2. Alternative CSS Approach (If avoiding JavaScript):**

While less efficient than `:nth-child`, use of the more robust `:nth-of-type` pseudo-class could provide a more reliable styling alternative. However, it would still be subject to large list performance considerations, but less prone to unpredictable breaks

```css
li:nth-of-type(even) {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

**3. Optimizing the List Structure (If possible):**

If feasible, changing the list structure to use fewer items by grouping or aggregation would reduce the number of elements the browser needs to process.  This is a high-level optimization and may not always be practical.
